							<h1>Small Azure Project: Setting Up Users, Groups, and Licenses in Microsoft Entra ID, Azure AD</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>If you're starting your career as a <strong>Cloud Engeneer</strong>, this project is a great way to build foundational knowledge of Azure resources. Understanding how Azure objects‚Äîsuch as resource groups, virtual networks, storage accounts, and role assignments‚Äîwork together is essential for designing and managing scalable, secure cloud environments.</p>
							<p><strong>In my role as a cloud engineer</strong>, I work with these types of resources on a daily basis. Whether I'm deploying infrastructure as code, setting up automation scripts, or troubleshooting issues in production environments, having a strong grasp of how these components function and interact is critical. This hands-on experience not only helps streamline operations but also ensures that environments are compliant, efficient, and aligned with best practices. </p>
							<p>In this post, we're building a small hands-on project in Microsoft Azure, where we‚Äôll simulate a real-world identity and access management setup. This is perfect for beginners and IT professionals looking to strengthen their understanding of Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), user/group management, and licensing.</p>
							<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
							<p>Before we start, make sure you have:</p>
							<p>An Azure account with administrator access.</p>
							<p>A valid Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant ‚Äî this is often created by default with your Azure account.</p>
							<p>Some available Microsoft 365 (M365) licenses ‚Äî such as E3 or E5 trial licenses (you can activate these for free during testing).</p>
							<p>A basic understanding of Azure navigation.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>üß± What We'll Build</h3>
							<p>‚úÖ Set up users (internal and guest)</p>
							<p>üë• Create user groups: security groups & Microsoft 365 groups</p>
							<p>üéØ Assign licenses to users and groups</p>
							<p>üîÅ Set up dynamic and assigned group memberships</p>
							<p>üåç Invite guest users to the tenant</p>

							<h3>Step 1: Sign in to Azure</h3>
							<p>Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure credentials.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/azportal.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Step 2: Access Microsoft Entra ID </h3>
							<p>Search for "Microsoft Entra ID" or "Azure Active Directory" in the top search bar.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Step 3: Create Users</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/user.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In Microsoft Azure, a user is an identity that can access and interact with Azure resources. These users are managed through Azure Microsoft Entra ID, and understanding the different types of users is essential for managing access securely and effectively.</p>
							<li>
								1. <strong>Member Users</strong> 

								 are internal users created directly within your Azure AD tenant. These accounts are typically used by employees or permanent staff within your organization. Member users have full access to resources depending on the roles assigned to them and are the default user type for internal team members.
								Example: user@yourcompany.com
							</li>	
							<li>
								2.<strong>Guest Users</strong> 

							    are external users invited to collaborate in your Azure tenant. These could be vendors, contractors, or partners who need limited access to specific resources. Guest users are added using their existing email addresses and are granted only the permissions you assign them.
								Example: external.partner@gmail.com
							</li>
							<h3>Lets get started</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1/user1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>First, go to Microsoft Entra ID and look for Users on your left side. You will notice, you have just one user which it most likely is your tenant user account. So lets create some new users.</strong> </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1/user2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>We will start with our friend Daniel Sim, he just joined our company and we just have to create his credentials and later on assign his license.</strong></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1/user3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>Also our good friend Dan White joined our company. As you can see, he as an external user, so we sent him an Invitation. He will get an email, and he has to accept the invitation so he can join our team.</strong>Lets remember what Guest User is: A guest user is created when you invite an external user to access your Azure resources‚Äîtypically through Azure AD B2B collaboration (Business-to-Business).</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1/user4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>We can see here a list of our users. Dan is our extarnal guest, as you can see.</strong></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1/user5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>Lets go to Tom Smith overview and see if he has a license. As you can see, he has not a license, so we have to assign him and to our other users a license.</strong></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1/licence1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>Go to https://admin.cloud.microsoft.com, log in with your credentials and you should see something like this:click + Assign licenses and chose the users you want to assign a license. </strong></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/az1/licence2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>You can see the users I choose to assign a license, which was the P2 license. P2 license gives you enterprise-grade identity protection and governance capabilities. It's ideal for organizations that need to:Protect against sophisticated threats (like identity theft), Automate identity governance,Secure high-privilege accounts. P2 is the highest-tier Azure AD license for identity security and governance. Who needs it? Enterprises, regulated industries, or anyone needing advanced security and what are the benefits of P2 license? PIM, Identity Protection, Access Reviews, Conditional Access (advanced). </strong></p>
